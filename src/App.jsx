        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely deployed for complex tasks where environmental dynamics are difficult to model explicitly. 
          However, the trial-and-error nature of RL presents significant challenges.
          RL often requires extensive interaction data, limiting use in domains where interaction is costly, and may raise safety concerns when undesirable actions are taken during exploration. 
          Lastly, generalizing and transferring knowledge across unseen tasks remains challenging, as agents may overfit to specific training conditions.
          These aspects are difficult to improve given the complexity and black-box nature of RL algorithms, limiting our ability to interpret decisions and diagnose failures.
          <br/>
          To address these challenges, researchers have increasingly incorporated external knowledge bases into RL frameworks from sources such as external datasets (e.g. YouTube videos), guiding policies, knowledge graphs, natural language instructions, program synthesis, or advanced sensing and control systems. External knowledge can improve sample efficiency by guiding exploration, enhance safety by reducing potentially unsafe interactions with the environment, and facilitate knowledge transfer across multiple environments and tasks during both learning and deployment.
          <br/>
          Foundation models have recently emerged as powerful external knowledge sources for RL, offering broad reasoning capabilities and multimodal understanding.
          These models can serve as priors for policy or value functions, as teachers and external reward generators, and as generalizable representation learners.
          They have also helped RL bridge perception, reasoning, and control in embodied domains such as robotics, while simultaneously benefiting from RL to align and refine their own outputs.
          This large-scale knowledge integration is driving advances in all aspects of RL.
          <br/>
          Despite recent breakthroughs, empowering RL with external knowledge bases -- from demonstrations to foundation models -- still presents significant challenges.
          These include (1) effectively leveraging external knowledge for decision-making; (2) reliability and timeliness of available information -- potentially leading to biased or outdated decisions; or even (3) conflicts between internally learned experiences and external information.
          In addition, computational requirements are amplified when leveraging large-scale external knowledge sources, potentially limiting the scalability and practicality of RL solutions, particularly for organizations and individuals without access to extensive resources.

        <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
        <p>
          This workshop explores techniques that improve RL across domains by leveraging external knowledge, and identifies common principles and limitations.
          The recent resurgence of RL, largely driven by advances in datasets and foundation models, has reignited enthusiasm and optimism in this field, creating a unique opportunity to bring together researchers from diverse backgrounds seeking to harness external knowledge for more efficient, reliable, and scalable RL.
          Conversations among researchers with different perspectives, but shared foundational goals, will help advance the reliability and computational efficiency of RL with external knowledge.
          <br/>
